# Document Style

**Key Words**

The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," "SHOULD,"
"SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this document's normative
statements are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119: Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

**Statement Type**

Please note an important distinction between different sections of text
throughout this document. There are two distinctive kinds of text: _informative
comments_ and _normative statements_. Because most of the text in this
specification will be of the kind _normative statements_, the authors have
informally defined it as the default and, as such, have specifically called out
text of the kind _informative comment_. They have done this by flagging the
beginning and end of each informative comment and highlighting its text in gray.
This means that unless text is specifically marked as of the kind _informative
comment_, it can be considered a _normative statement_.

EXAMPLE:

> This is the first paragraph of 1â€“n paragraphs containing text of the kind
> informative comment ...
>
> This is the second paragraph of text of the kind informative comment ...
>
> This is the nth paragraph of text of the kind informative comment ...
>
> To understand the TCG specification, the user must read the specification.
> (This use of MUST does not require any action).
